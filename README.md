## TASK -2
Clean the data by:

removing rows that have values which are missing,
changing the data type of some values within a column, and
removing columns which are not relevant to this task.
Think about how each column might be relevant to the business question you’re investigating. If you can’t think of why a column may be useful, it may not be worth including it.

1. Create a final data set by merging your three tables together

We recommend using the Reaction table as your base table, then first join the relevant columns from your Content data set, and then the Reaction Types data set.
Hint: You can use a “VLookUp” formula
 
2. Figure out the Top 5 performing categories

Add up the total scores for each category.
Hint: You can use the “Sum If” formula

The end result should be one spreadsheet which contains:

A cleaned dataset
The top 5 categories
